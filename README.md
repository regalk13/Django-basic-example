# Django Password Generator

Simple app made in Django, using Boostrap for styles. This works for create random passwords with adding special characters or numbers. (DON'T use this for real passwords is just for test Django).

Django is a framework for python whit this you can create web sites in few lines of code, controling FrontEnd and BackEnd in a great way. Possibilities are endless even create API's as I will show in next repos.

# Requirements
- Python (Preferably Python 3. or 3.10)
- Django `pip install django`
- Editor of code.

# How to run

Clone this repo and just run:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
And open the link gived for default, localhost:8000. Now you can edit code in the files this will be show in realtime on the website. For that read the [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/) docs and maybe [Boostrab](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) docs for the styles created (anyways you can use css vanilla).
